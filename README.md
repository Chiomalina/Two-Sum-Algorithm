# Two-Sum-Algorithm
🧩 Two Sum Problem — Clean & Efficient Python Solutions

A concise yet powerful demonstration of algorithmic problem-solving in Python.
This project showcases both the naive O(n²) and optimized O(n) solutions to the classic Two Sum problem, built with professional code structure, clarity, and full automated testing.

🚀 Project Overview

The Two Sum problem asks:

Given an array of integers and a target value, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to that target.

This repository implements two distinct approaches:

🔁 Naive Algorithm approach that Checks all possible pairs using nested loops with O(n²) time complexity.

⚡ Hash Map Algorithm approach stores complements in a dictionary for O(1) lookups and uses O(n) time complexity.
