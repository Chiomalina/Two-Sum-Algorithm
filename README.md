# Two-Sum-Algorithm
🧩 Two Sum Problem — Clean & Efficient Python Solutions

A concise yet powerful demonstration of algorithmic problem-solving in Python.
This project showcases both the naive O(n²) and optimized O(n) solutions to the classic Two Sum problem, built with professional code structure, clarity, and full automated testing.

🚀 Project Overview

The Two Sum problem asks:

Given an array of integers and a target value, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to that target.

This repository implements two distinct approaches:

Approach	Description	Time Complexity
🔁 Naive Algorithm	Checks all possible pairs using nested loops.	O(n²)
⚡ Hash Map Algorithm	Stores complements in a dictionary for O(1) lookups.	O(n)
